## Skill Level
Empyrean assembly is intended for those who have had a small amount of experience in assembling and soldering electronics kits. All of the parts are already mounted to the PCB, with the exception of the pin headers, which are through-hole components, so no special skills are required other than basic through-hole soldering ability.

## Tools and Equipment
Below are a list of tools and equipment that are used to assemble Empyrean.

### Required
* Soldering iron
* Needle-nose pliers
* Diagonal cutters

## Precautions
While we take the utmost care to ensure that OpenBeacon works as expected, since this is a kit, we cannot be held responsible for any damages done to your equipment or PC through the assembly or use of the product.
